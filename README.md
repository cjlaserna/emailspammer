# emailspammer
fuck terror bill all my homies hate terror bill
## *Purpose*
- This was made for the Black Lives Matter Movement and to help send emails about the Terror Bill at the Philippines.

# Actual Python Files
## *jtbleaveon.py (The actual email spammer)*
- This file sends an email with a random pre-made template to a random Filipino government representative about rejecting the Terror Bill. It only sends an email every 3 minutes because a Gmail account only lets me send 500 emails a day. I can't technically "spam" without using burner emails. 
## *emailfile.py*
- This is what I started out with. It has basic commands that I use again for the actual email spammer.

# The text files
## *blmemails.txt*
- List of California reps to email about defunding the police.
## *blmletter.txt*
- A letter pleading to defund the police.
## *jtbemails.txt*
- 106 emails of people in power that could help junk terror bill
## *jbtcontent.txt*
- A list of email body pre-mades to spam with.

# *The important one*
## .env
- Has email username/pass
